As they met with the informant, Shallan learned that her own family\'s own highprince, Valam, was preparing to assault Vedenar itself. The informant continued with information on the deserters Shallan had recruited. To Shallan\'s dismay, Tyn insisted that they should turn the men over in exchange for reward. Her resistance prompted a firm lecture from Tyn, which left Shallan distracted by how to handle the situation. A new message soon came with news regarding the presumed death of Jasnah Kholin. As Shallan began to realize that Tyn was involved with the Ghostbloods, additional information came through about Jasnah\'s ward--Shallan herself. Tyn quickly realized the truth and attacked Shallan. Pattern was able to distract the woman for a short time by using Jasnah\'s voice, but when she finally approached Shallan with sword drawn, Shallan swiftly summoned Pattern as a Shardblade and pierced her through the chest.

Shallan swore them to silence and set them about searching through Tyn\'s things.

Unable to delay the meeting, Shallan explained that she--Tyn--was wounded, and that her apprentice would appear for the meeting instead. Shallan practiced her Lightweaving as she waited for the meeting to be coordinated, inventing a false identity to use as Tyn\'s supposed apprentice--a false identity she would soon come to name \\"Veil.\\" With everything organized and her identity covered by an illusion, Shallan snuck out of her room and into the night. Shallan eventually located the building she had been directed to in Sebarial\'s camp. The guard at the entrance allowed her to enter and then led her down into a basement and through a trapdoor. In the stately room below, Shallan met Mraize and an audience of silent onlookers, including masked Iyatil. Though disappointed not to see Tyn herself, Mraize decided to spare \\"Veil\'s\\" life, intrigued by her boldness.

Shallan arrived early, hoping to catch the delivery of these instructions, but after a long wait with no arrivals she began to wonder if the Ghostbloods were attempting to watch her in turn. She had Pattern search the windows of the tenement she waited on and was able to trick a spying Iyatil into revealing herself. The masked woman explained that the instructions provided were supposed to be carried out immediately, so that the Ghostbloods could watch Veil at work. When Shallan pressed, she explained that her task was to investigate a strange madman who had arrived in the warcamps under the custody of one of Dalinar Kholin\'s most trusted footmen. Determined to impress the Ghostbloods, Shallan invited Iyatil to join her on the task.\\n\\nThe women rode a palanquin to the temple complex in Dalinar\'s warcamps, where Shallan simply used her own identity to gain entrance while Iyatil was distracted. They reached the building where the man--none other than the Herald Talenel--was being kept, along with other mentally ill patients. Shallan then convinced the ardents that Iyatil was possessed by a Voidbringer, giving her a distraction to slip through unnoticed as well as a mean to escape from Iyatil\'s observation, and snuck into Taln\'s dimly lit room. Though the crazed man reacted minimally at first, constantly reciting his repetitive speech about his nature and purpose, an attempt to Surgebind by Shallan caused him to snap into a brief intense lucidity in which he seemed to recognize her as a Knight Radiant. Dazed after drawing her Shardblade in fear, Shallan was unable to leave before Meridas Amaram arrived with Bordin to question the man himself. Shallan hid behind a Lightweaving as the brightlord asked questions of the man without success, revealing to Shallan that he believed the words of the Herald to be true. After the two new arrivals departed, Shallan returned to Iyatil with information about Taln\'s rambling speech and the arrival of Amaram. Later that evening she delivered a full report via spanreed.

At the Middlefest Fair of 1170 Shallan put several of these plans into action after seizing an opportunity to leave her father\'s side when Lin and Malise began discussing the terms of a one-sided trade deal with Brightlord Revilar. Accompanied by a guard, Jix, Shallan sought out Eylita Tavinar and then delivered a message from her to Balat in the festival\'s gambling pavilion. Shallan revealed to Balat that she had seen the two eyeing one another and so had organized an opportunity for the two to meet and walk together. With Balat on his way to meet Eylita, Shallan returned to find her father concluding a meeting with an unfamiliar messenger who came with news from Helaran. The man gave a start of surprise upon seeing Shallan, and then dumped a powdery substance into his own cup before departing. When Shallan prodded for the news, Lin declared Helaran to be officially disinherited and named Nan Balat his heir. He then asked Shallan to speak with Wikim, who had refused to leave the family\'s carriage. Shallan took this opportunity to leave again, and found Wikim where he had been left. After discussing the family\'s battered state with Wikim, Shallan proffered several sheets of math problems related to highstorm timing calculations, which she had taken from her father\'s books and translated into glyphs. Seeing through her intent, Wikim belittled her efforts, but he could later be seen working the problems attentively and with a smile. Leaving the carriage feeling dejected, Shallan crossed paths with Helaran\'s messenger. The man, later revealed to be Wit, shared what little news he had of Helaran: that Shallan\'s brother was in good health, \\"doing things he finds very important,\\" and keeping an eye on their father. He then began to ask pointed questions of Shallan, suggesting that he was aware of her family\'s brokenness and Shallan\'s Surgebinding abilities. After sharing a story about two blind men contemplating beauty, Wit asked Shallan to indulge him with her own definition of beauty. With some prompting, Shallan began to describe a idyllic scene of her family--all present, including her mother and eldest brother--in their gardens, interacting with one another in love and joy. As she spoke, Wit held out a handful of infused spheres, which Shallan subconsciously used to Lightweave the scene described. Realizing what she was doing, Shallan withdrew her abilities. Wit encouraged her, suggesting that their struggles are partially caused by an Unmade or some other supernatural force. Apparently satisfied with what he had discovered of her abilities, Wit then bowed, disclosed that Helaran was currently in Alethkar, and left.","chapter":"*Words of Radiance* Ch. 45"},"shallan-recruits-deserters":{"name":"Shallan recruits deserters","blurb":"Shallan recruited several deserters, including Vathah, Gaz, and Red, and saves Tyn and her caravan from bandits.","details":"On the journey to the Shattered Plains, Shallan emerged from her carriage one evening just as they moved near enough to determine a the caravan ahead was under attack. As they approached while the sun set, they encountered Tyn--the head of the new caravan\'s guard--who explained that the bandits who attacked them were still nearby. As this group began to attack again, Shallan turned with Bluth to confront the group of bandits following behind. Finding these men to be deserters from the Shattered Plains, Shallan appealed to their sense of honor and made promises of forgiven debts and pardons. She succeeded in convincing them, with a Lightweaving to aid her, and these men charged off to join the battle. They proved victorious, but not without cost. Shallan found Bluth dead, among dozens of his comrades. He was however clutching the sketch Shallan had drawn of him earlier in the day, indicating that Bluth was inspired by Shallan\'s sketch to uphold a sense of honor that Bluth originally assumed he had abandoned, resulting in a surprising amount of dead bandits surrounding Bluth\'s body in the aftermath of the battle. It is assumed that the inspiration of honor from Shallan\'s sketch inspired Bluth to risk everything, including his own life, for the chance of becoming the person he saw as himself in Shallan\'s sketch. Shallan then spoke with the caravan\'s owner, Macob, and they agreed to accompany one another to the warcamps at the Shattered Plains. Shallan then seized Tvlakv\'s slaves, claiming them as payment in exchange for saving his life.

As she considered the strange sight, the crew began calling attention to a santhid which was spotted following the ship. Desiring to sketch the nearly mythological creature, Shallan attempted to have Captain Tozbek stop the ship, but the man refused her requests leaving Shallan deflated. Jasnah emerged from her cabin shortly afterwards and, seeing that Shallan was distracted by her visit to the strange realm of Shadesmar, explained the basic nature of the Cognitive Realm and spren to satiate Shallan\'s curiosity. When Shallan expressed concern for her brothers\' situation, Jasnah explained that she had taken some actions to alleviate their problems. She had corresponded earlier in the day with her mother, Navani Kholin, making plans both to repair the broken Soulcaster and to establish a causal betrothal between Shallan and Adolin Kholin. This would solve the Davars\' financial problems and satiate the Ghostbloods while also tying Shallan closer to Jasnah. Humbled by Jasnah\'s opinion of her potential, their conversation turned towards Shallan\'s self-doubt, to which Jasnah explained that power and influence is often nothing more than an illusion. Encouraged and emboldened by Jasnah, Shallan commanded Tozbek to stop the ship and lower her into the sea, where she was able to capture a Memory of the santhid for later sketching.","chapter":"*Words of Radiance* Ch. 1"},"shallan-visits-shadesmar":{"name":"Shallan visits Shadesmar","blurb":"After drawing Cryptics again, Shallan fled to her rooms and accidentally peeked into Shadesmar while Soulcasting.

Kabsal offered to come with her, but Shallan refused him a final time. Wounded, Kabsal asked for a sketch of himself before she departed, and Shallan suddenly realized that she had never drawn one of him during her time in Kharbranth. They hurried back to the Veil, and Shallan set to drawing the young man through tears. Kabsal then insisted that she draw a second image of them together in exchange for payment. Shallan used a mirror to capture a Memory of the pair of them and began to sketch while filled with feelings of guilt and anxiety. As she wrestled with these emotions, Shallan once again accidentally sketched the form of a Cryptic, standing behind Kabsal. Crushed by the weight of her circumstances and concerned for her mental state, Shallan declared that she had made a mistake and dashed from the balcony seeking privacy. As she took the lift down to the main level Shallan took another Memory of the landing above. Upon quickly sketching the scene, two of the symbol-headed figures stood above, watching her. Shallan fled to her quarters as quickly as possible, pausing for one more moment along the way to draw another sketch, this time with five of the creatures following her. She hid in her room, huddled on the bed with doors locked, as she began yet another sketch of her surroundings which revealed a group of the Cryptics surrounding her, one of them reaching out as if to touch her. Despite her promises to herself not to use the blade ever since her mother\'s death, Shallan began to summon her secret Shardblade out of pure terror. She was interrupted then by a voice, asking, \\"What are you?\\" With her response, \\"I\'m terrified,\\" the room around her crashed into beads and Shallan found herself in Shadesmar for the first time. Though only there for a moment, she accidentally managed to Soulcast the crystal goblet beside her bed into blood. Assuming that the transformation was related to the device she carried in her safepouch, Shallan was shocked out of fear momentarily and began to ponder what she had done. Jasnah, however, had followed quickly and began knocking on Shallan\'s door. Out of concern that Jasnah would discover the blood and realize Shallan had the Soulcaster, she took a shard of glass that was broken in the accident and cut a gash in her own wrist. As Jasnah entered the room, Shallan slipped into unconsciousness.","chapter":"*The Way of Kings* Ch. 45"},"shallan-visits-the-breakaway":{"name":"Shallan visits the Breakaway","blurb":"Shallan visited the Breakaway to help investigate the murders.","details":"Seeking clues for the investigation of Torol Sadeas\'s murderer, Shallan enterned All\'s Alley in disguise as Veil and ordered a Horneater white.

In order to learn more information on the murder, Veil stabbed one of the thugs in the hand for pushing her out of his chair and threatened them by revealing her association with the Ghostbloods. While interrogating them, Betha, one of the thugs, revealed that a man named Ned had strangled his wife to death. Believing she had reached a dead end, Veil began to make her way out of the bar. Before she left, she overheard Betha mention another murder that occurred in the markets while conversing with Ur, the thug Veil had just stabbed. As she returned to the thugs, Betha quickly informed Veil that a barmaid had also died a similar way, but Ned vehemently denied any connection to the second murder before Ur killed him for supposedly killing the barmaid.
